# Firestore fullscreen (Chrome extension)

Get a fullscreen experience when browsing the Firestore database.

Have you ever spent time browsing the firestore database and wondered why the 3 columns section had to be on such a small screen area? 
This extension adds a button in the interface which toggles fullscreen mode. When in fullscreen mode, the 3 columns table takes the whole screen area so that you can browse easily. Click again on the button to exit the fullscreen mode and get back to normal.

No data is read or collected, the extension only adds the button and changes some CSS properties.
